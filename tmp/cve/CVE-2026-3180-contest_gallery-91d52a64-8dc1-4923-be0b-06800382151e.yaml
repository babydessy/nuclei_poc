    Contest Gallery <= 28.1.4 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Contest Gallery – Upload & Vote Photos, Media, Sell with PayPal & Stripe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the ‘cgLostPasswordEmail’ and the ’cgl_mail’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 28.1.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The vulnerability's ’cgLostPasswordEmail’ parameter was patched in version 28.1.4, and the ’cgl_mail’ parameter was patched in version 28.1.5.
